QUESTION 1: IS IT INSIGHTFUL?
QUESTION 2: DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)?
QUESTION 3: IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY BUT HIERARCHICALLY?
QUESTION 4: IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING?
QUESTION 5: ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"?
QUESTION 6: DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE?
QUESTION 7: IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL?
QUESTION 8: DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)?
QUESTION 9: IS IT ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY THE SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)?
QUESTION 10: IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY?
QUESTION 11: DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC?
QUESTION 12: IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
QUESTION 13: IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN?
QUESTION 14: ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
QUESTION 15: IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT?
QUESTION 16: ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS?
QUESTION 17: DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT?
