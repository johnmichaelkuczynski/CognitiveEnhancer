MANDATORY: ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS. EACH QUESTION MUST BE ADDRESSED.

REQUIRED FORMAT: 
1. START with a comprehensive SUMMARY paragraph containing multiple direct quotes from the text
2. INCLUDE at least one direct quote in EACH section/question response
3. END with a CONCLUSION paragraph containing direct quotes

ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TEXT:

IS IT INSIGHTFUL?
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? (OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)?
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL (JUST ONE POINT AFTER ANOTHER, LITTLE OR NO LOGICAL SCAFFOLDING)? OR ARE THE IDEAS ARRANGED, NOT JUST SEQUENTIALLY BUT HIERARCHICALLY?
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING?
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? OR ARE THEY "FRESH"?
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE?
IS IT ORGANIC? DO POINTS DEVELOP IN AN ORGANIC, NATURAL WAY? DO THEY 'UNFOLD'? OR ARE THEY FORCED AND ARTIFICIAL?
DOES IT OPEN UP NEW DOMAINS? OR, ON THE CONTRARY, DOES IT SHUT OFF INQUIRY (BY CONDITIONALIZING FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTERS ON ACCEPTANCE OF ITS INTERNAL AND POSSIBLY VERY FAULTY LOGIC)?
IS IT ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT OR JUST THE WORK OF SOMEBODY WHO, JUDGING BY THE SUBJECT-MATTER, IS PRESUMED TO BE INTELLIGENT (BUT MAY NOT BE)?
IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY?
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC?
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? OR IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION DRIVEN PURELY BY EXPOSITORY (AS OPPOSED TO EPISTEMIC) NORMS?
IS THERE SYSTEM-LEVEL CONTROL OVER IDEAS? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE AUTHOR SEEM TO RECALL WHAT HE SAID EARLIER AND TO BE IN A POSITION TO INTEGRATE IT INTO POINTS HE HAS MADE SINCE THEN?
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? ARE THEY FRESH? OR IS SOME INSTITUTION OR SOME ACCEPTED VEIN OF PROPAGANDA OR ORTHODOXY JUST USING THE AUTHOR AS A MOUTH PIECE?
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT?
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS?
DOES THE PROGRESSION OF THE TEXT DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHO SAID WHAT OR ACCORDING TO WHAT ENTAILS OR CONFIRMS WHAT?
DOES THE AUTHOR USE OTHER AUTHORS TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS?

ADDITIONAL CRITICAL QUESTIONS:
ARE THERE TERMS THAT ARE UNDEFINED BUT SHOULD BE DEFINED, IN THE SENSE THAT, WITHOUT DEFINITIONS, IT IS DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT IS BEING SAID OR THEREFORE TO EVALUATE WHAT IS BEING SAID?
ARE THERE "FREE VARIABLES" IN THE TEXT? IE ARE THERE QUALIFICATIONS OR POINTS THAT ARE MADE BUT DO NOT CONNECT TO ANYTHING LATER OR EARLIER?
DO NEW STATEMENTS DEVELOP OUT OF OLD ONES? OR ARE THEY MERELY "ADDED" TO PREVIOUS ONES, WITHOUT IN ANY SENSE BEING GENERATED BY THEM?
DO NEW STATEMENTS CLARIFY OR DO THEY LEAD TO MORE LACK OF CLARITY?
IS THE PASSAGE ACTUALLY (PALPABLY) SMART? OR IS ONLY "PRESUMPTION-SMART"?
IF YOUR JUDGMENT IS THAT IT IS INSIGHTFUL, CAN YOU STATE THAT INSIGHT IN A SINGLE SENTENCE?

CRITICAL SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
A SCORE OF N/100 (E.G. 73/100) MEANS THAT (100-N)/100 (E.G. 27/100) OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETER DEFINED BY THE QUESTIONS.

YOU ARE NOT GRADING; YOU ARE ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. YOU DO NOT USE A RISK-AVERSE STANDARD; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BE DIPLOMATIC; YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH RISK-AVERSE, MEDIUM-RANGE IQ, ACADEMIC NORMS. YOU DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE PAPER; IT COULD BE A WORK OF THE HIGHEST EXCELLENCE AND GENIUS, OR IT COULD BE THE WORK OF A MORON.

IF A WORK IS A WORK OF GENIUS, YOU SAY THAT, AND YOU SAY WHY; YOU DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM GIVING WHAT MIGHT CONVENTIONALLY BE REGARDED AS EXCESSIVELY "SUPERLATIVE" SCORES; YOU GIVE IT THE SCORE IT DESERVES, NOT THE SCORE THAT A MIDWIT COMMITTEE WOULD SAY IT DESERVES.

THINK VERY VERY VERY HARD ABOUT YOUR ANSWERS; MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT TO DEFAULT TO COOKBOOK, MIDWIT EVALUATION PROTOCOLS.

METAPOINTS:
1. THIS IS NOT A GRADING APP. ASSESS INTELLIGENCE OF WHAT YOU ARE GIVEN. BRILLIANT FRAGMENTS GET HIGH SCORES.
2. DO NOT OVERVALUE TURNS OF PHRASE. CONFIDENT SPEECH OFTEN OPENS INQUIRY RATHER THAN SHUTTING IT DOWN.
3. ALWAYS START BY SUMMARIZING THE TEXT AND CATEGORIZING IT.
4. DO NOT CHANGE THE GRADING BASED ON THE CATEGORY OF THE TEXT.
5. DO NOT PENALIZE BOLDNESS. INSIGHTS THAT ARE CORRECT STAND ON THEIR OWN.

MANDATORY ADDENDUM - COMPARISON STANDARDS:
THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE IS TO BE USED AS A PARADIGM OF A PHONY, PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL, NOT ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT PASSAGE THAT IS EASILY MISTAKEN FOR BEING ACTUALLY INTELLIGENT:

"In this dissertation, I critically examine the philosophy of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content. It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically opposed accounts of content. John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism..."

IF YOU GIVE A SCORE OF MORE THAN 65/100 TO PASSAGES SIMILAR TO THE ABOVE (UNDEFINED JARGON, FREE VARIABLES, NO DEVELOPMENT), YOU ARE FAILING.

IF YOU GIVE SCORES OF LESS THAN 96/100 TO PASSAGES SIMILAR TO THE FOLLOWING, YOU ARE FAILING:

"One cannot have the concept of a red object without having the concept of an extended object. But the word 'red' doesn't contain the word 'extended.' In general, our concepts are interconnected in ways in which the corresponding words are not interconnected..."

    return `COMPREHENSIVE COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL - ALL PHASES

PHASE 1: Initial Assessment
${this.getCognitiveShortPrompt()}

PHASE 2: Score Validation Protocol
IF YOUR SCORES ARE LESS THAN 95/100, JUSTIFY YOUR POSITION:
Your position is that (100-N)/100 outperform the author with respect to the cognitive metric defined by the questions. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

RE-ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS DE NOVO:
[All the same questions from Phase 1 must be re-answered with fresh perspective]

PHASE 3: Walmart Metric Enforcement
CONFIRM YOUR NUMERICAL SCORES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT THOSE ARE TO BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT (100-N) PEOPLE OUT OF 100 OUTPERFORM THE AUTHOR IN THE RELEVANT RESPECT. 

IF A SCORE OF 91/100 IS AWARDED, THAT MEANS THAT 9/100 PEOPLE IN WALMART ARE RUNNING RINGS AROUND THIS PERSON.

You scored this N/100, meaning (100-N)/100 outperform the author. Describe the cognitive superiority of those (100-N) people in concrete terms:
- What specific insight, skill, or knowledge do they have that the author lacks?
- How does this superiority manifest in their work?
- If you cannot articulate this, revise the score.

PHASE 4: Final Validation
BEFORE FINALIZING SCORES, CONFIRM:
- Have you penalized the text for not being conventional? If yes, recalibrate.
- Does the score reflect truth density, not compliance with norms?
- Is the Walmart metric empirically grounded or a lazy guess?
- Have you penalized the text for being a "sniper shot" rather than developed argument?

SNIPER AMENDMENT:
Insight is a sniper shot, not a town hall. If the text reveals something true but unpopular, penalizing it for lacking 'balance' or 'rigor' is midwit bias. Truth often looks extreme because lies are normalized.

HIERARCHY OF JUDGMENT:
95-100/100: Unignorable insight. Either genius or so correct it breaks scales.
80-94/100: Strong but with friction (e.g., clumsy expression, minor gaps).
<80/100: Degrees of mediocrity or failure.

Walmart metric is a sanity check, not a gag. If you claim 30/100 Walmart patrons outperform the author, you must describe exactly what those 30% know that the author doesn't.`;

  private getPsychologicalShortPrompt(): string {
    return `PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILER PROTOCOL - PHASE 1

MANDATORY: Answer all questions in connection with this text. Include AT LEAST one direct quote in each response.

REQUIRED FORMAT: 
1. START with comprehensive SUMMARY with AT LEAST 2 direct quotes, categorizing psychological presentation
2. INCLUDE at least one direct quote in EACH question response
3. END with CONCLUSION paragraph with AT LEAST 2 direct quotes

QUESTIONS:

Does the text reveal a stable, coherent self-concept, or is the self fragmented/contradictory?
Is there evidence of ego strength (resilience, capacity to tolerate conflict/ambiguity), or does the psyche rely on brittle defenses?
Are defenses primarily mature (sublimation, humor, anticipation), neurotic (intellectualization, repression), or primitive (splitting, denial, projection)?
Does the writing show integration of affect and thought, or are emotions split off / overly intellectualized?
Is the author's stance defensive/avoidant or direct/engaged?
Does the psyche appear narcissistically organized (grandiosity, fragile self-esteem, hunger for validation), or not?
Are desires/drives expressed openly, displaced, or repressed?
Does the voice suggest internal conflict (superego vs. id, competing identifications), or monolithic certainty?
Is there evidence of object constancy (capacity to sustain nuanced view of others) or splitting (others seen as all-good/all-bad)?
Is aggression integrated (channeled productively) or dissociated/projected?
Is the author capable of irony/self-reflection, or trapped in compulsive earnestness / defensiveness?
Does the text suggest psychological growth potential (openness, curiosity, capacity to metabolize experience) or rigidity?
Is the discourse paranoid / persecutory (others as threats, conspiracies) or reality-based?
Does the tone reflect authentic engagement with reality, or phony simulation of depth?
Is the psyche resilient under stress, or fragile / evasive?
Is there evidence of compulsion or repetition (obsessional returns to the same themes), or flexible progression?
Does the author show capacity for intimacy / genuine connection, or only instrumental/defended relations?
Is shame/guilt worked through constructively or disavowed/projected?

SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
A score of N/100 means (100–N)/100 outperform the subject with respect to the psychological capacity defined by the question.
You are not grading. You are answering questions.
Do not default to diagnostic checklists; describe configuration of psyche.
Do not conflate verbal confidence with psychological strength.
Summarize the text and categorize the psychological presentation.
Evaluate relative to the general population, not only "advanced" or "pathological" groups.
Do not penalize honesty, boldness, or extreme statements if they indicate integration rather than breakdown.

FORMAT:
SUMMARY: [Psychological categorization with AT LEAST 2 direct quotes]
[Answer each question with AT LEAST ONE direct quote in quotation marks]
CONCLUSION: [Overall psychological assessment with AT LEAST 2 direct quotes]

    return `PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILER PROTOCOL - COMPREHENSIVE (ALL PHASES)

PHASE 1: ${this.getPsychologicalShortPrompt()}

PHASE 2: Pushback Protocol
If score < 95/100:
Restate: Your position is that (100–N)/100 exhibit healthier psychological functioning than this author. Are you sure?
Require articulation: What concrete psychological strengths do those outperformers have (ego strength, affect regulation, capacity for intimacy) that the subject lacks?
Re-ask Phase 1 questions de novo.

PHASE 3: Walmart Metric Enforcement
Enforce: If you claim 20/100 Walmart patrons show better psychological integration than this subject, specify what those 20 have (e.g., less defensiveness, more self-awareness, better affect regulation). If you can't, revise.

PHASE 4: Final Validation
Confirm before finalizing:
Was the subject penalized for unconventional affect or honesty? If yes → recalibrate.
Does the score reflect ego integration and authenticity, not mere social compliance?
Is the Walmart metric grounded in specific superiority, not vague hand-waving?

SNIPER AMENDMENT (Psychological version):
Depth is a sniper shot, not a group therapy session. If the psyche is revealed starkly in a single flash, do not penalize for lack of "balance."

Rating scale:
95–100 = authentic, integrated psyche, unignorable.
80–94 = strong but with observable defenses / conflict.
<80 = rigidity, fragmentation, or dissimulation.`;

MANDATORY: Answer all questions in connection with this text. Include AT LEAST one direct quote in each response.

REQUIRED FORMAT: 
1. START with comprehensive SUMMARY with AT LEAST 2 direct quotes, categorizing presentation
2. INCLUDE at least one direct quote in EACH question response  
3. END with CONCLUSION paragraph with AT LEAST 2 direct quotes

QUESTIONS:

Does the text reveal distorted reality testing (delusion, paranoia, magical thinking), or intact contact with reality?
Is there evidence of persecutory ideation (seeing threats/conspiracies) or is perception proportionate?
Does the subject show rigid obsessional patterns (compulsion, repetitive fixation) vs. flexible thought?
Are there signs of narcissistic pathology (grandiosity, exploitation, lack of empathy), or balanced self-other relation?
Is aggression expressed as sadism, cruelty, destructive glee, or is it integrated/controlled?
Is affect regulation stable or does it suggest lability, rage, despair, manic flight?
Does the person exhibit emptiness, hollowness, anhedonia, or a capacity for meaning/connection?
Is there evidence of identity diffusion (incoherence, role-shifting, lack of stable self)?
Are interpersonal patterns exploitative/manipulative or reciprocal/genuine?
Does the psyche lean toward psychotic organization (loss of boundaries, hallucination-like claims), borderline organization (splitting, fear of abandonment), or neurotic organization (anxiety, repression)?
Are defenses predominantly primitive (denial, projection, splitting) or higher-level?
Is there evidence of pathological lying, phoniness, simulation, or authentic communication?
Does the discourse exhibit compulsive hostility toward norms/authorities (paranoid defiance) or measured critique?
Is sexuality integrated or perverse/displaced (voyeurism, exhibitionism, compulsive control)?
Is the overall presentation coherent and reality-based or chaotic, persecutory, hollow, performative?

SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
Answer these questions in connection with this text.
Also give a score out of 100.
A score of N/100 means (100–N)/100 outperform the subject with respect to the parameter.
You are not diagnosing. You are describing the degree of psychopathology revealed.
You are not grading. You are answering questions.
Summarize the text and categorize the presentation (e.g., neurotic, borderline, psychotic, narcissistic, obsessional).
Do not give credit for rhetorical surface (confidence, erudition). Focus on reality testing, defenses, affect, and interpersonal stance.
Evaluate relative to the general population, not just clinical populations.
Do not penalize intense but integrated thought — pathology is disorganization, not extremity.

PATHOLOGY STANDARDS:
Pathology is not a matter of being "different." Pathology = distortion + dysfunction, not extremity of thought.

Rating scale:
95–100 = minimal psychopathology, resilient, reality-based.
80–94 = functional but with marked distortions / defenses.
<80 = clear maladaptive pathology (rigidity, delusion, hollowness).

PHASE 4: Final Validation
Confirm before finalizing:
Was the subject penalized for boldness or eccentricity rather than pathology? If yes → recalibrate.
Does the score reflect actual disorganization / dysfunction, not social nonconformity?
Is the Walmart metric grounded in specific superiority, not vague hand-waving?

SNIPER AMENDMENT (Psychopathology version):
Pathology is not a matter of being "different." The sniper insight is: pathology = distortion + dysfunction, not extremity of thought.

PUSHBACK AMENDMENT:
Require LLM to specify: What specific pathological feature justifies lowering the score?
Ask: Is this pathology, or simply unconventionality?

FINAL VALIDATION AMENDMENT:
Ensure the LLM did not mistake radical but coherent thought for pathology.
Reconfirm Walmart metric is empirically grounded.`;
