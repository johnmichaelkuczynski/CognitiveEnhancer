--

* 3: Is the merely sequential (just one after another, little or logical scaffolding)? are the ideas hierarchically?*  
The is*hierarchical not merely sequential. The introduces basic concepts first (syntonic/dyst), then applies them to disorders, addresses objections/cexamples from clinical literature,ines his thesis with new (“structural” “functional”), and synthesizes these into overarching summary.

Development feelsorganic:** each grows out of precedes; arise naturally from claims; refinements respond directly to those objections rather than tackedon or arbitrary--

*QUESTION 8: Does it open up new/in—or shut by conditionalizing discussion on acceptance its own logic/definitions/etc.?*
